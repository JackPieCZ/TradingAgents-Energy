Abstract
Optimal execution, i.e., the determination of the most cost-effective way to trade volumes in
continuous trading sessions, has been a topic of interest in the equity trading world for years.
Electricity intraday trading slowly follows this trend but is far from being well-researched.
The underlying problem is a very complex one. Energy traders, producers, and electricity
wholesale companies receive various position updates from customer businesses, renewable
energy production, or plant outages and need to trade these positions in intraday markets.
They have a variety of options when it comes to position sizing or timing. Is it better to
trade all amounts at once? Should they split orders into smaller pieces? Taking the German
continuous hourly intraday market as an example, this paper derives an appropriate model
for electricity trading. We present our results from an out-of-sample study and differentiate
between simple benchmark models and our more refined optimization approach that takes
into account order book depth, time to delivery, and different trading regimes like XBID
(Cross-Border Intraday Project) trading. Our paper is highly relevant as it contributes
further insight into the academic discussion of algorithmic execution in continuous intraday

1. Introduction
Intraday markets are of tremendous importance in German electricity trading. Traded vol-
umes rise from year to year and set a new record in 2019 (EPEX Spot SE [9]). The growing
share of renewable energy requires market participants to balance their positions in very
short-term intraday markets and causes more traded volume close before delivery (Koch
and Hirth [27]). Intraday trading is usually used for rebalancing after power plant out-
ages, updated consumption forecasts, or speculative trading approaches, as demonstrated
by Maciejowska et al. [29]. This paper refers to hourly continuous intraday trading, leaving
quarter-hourly trading and intraday auctions aside. The German market allowed for trad-
ing up to five minutes before delivery in mid-2020 coupled with other European intraday
markets, as Kath [24] analyzed and worked on a pay-as-bid basis, meaning that orders were
continuously matched and executed at their respective prices. Figure 1 displays the different
time lines of German hourly intraday trading, including the coupling among markets under
the Cross-border intraday project (XBID). More information on the German market is also
provided by Viehmann [42].
While the German intraday market itself has develoed into a central market-place, its
many simultaneously traded hours have also brought another topic to the agenda: auto-
mated and algorithmic trading. The term describes the algorithm-aided execution of trades
or liquidity provision strategies, as mentioned by Hendershott and Riordan [20]. Herein, we
will drill down our focus to optimal execution and leave liquidity provision strategies aside.
The continuous matching process is crucial in understanding the main issue of optimal ex-
ecution. Energy companies face a practical problem: Their trading books are flooded with
volumes, which may stem from outages, renewable generation, or trading decisions. But how
can they execute the volumes in an optimal way? A market participant could trade the entire
volume at once, wait for a better point in time with more favorable prices, or even slice the
volume into many small portions to be traded. The slicing aspect, or the determination of
an optimal trading trajectory, is what optimal execution aims to identify.
There is a rich body of literature on analytical aspects that discuss market determinants,
such as Kiesel and Paraschiv [26], Hagemann [18], Narajewski and Ziel [33], Pape et al. [35],
and forecasting approaches, like Uniejewski et al. [41], Janke and Steinke [23], Kath and Ziel
[25], and [25]. From a practical perspective, these papers only discuss reasons for the price
movements and predictability of intraday trading but leave the question of ’how to trade’
open. The problem of executing orders in the most optimal way was referred to by Garnier
and Madlener [12] and Aïd et al. [1] with a strict focus on renewable energy source (RES)

generation. However, what the current academic discussion misses is a more generic discus-
sion of optimal execution strategies in the German electricity intraday market. While there
are many stochastic models under the umbrella of equity trading (e.g., Almgren and Chriss
[2], Almgren [3], Bertsimas and Lo [4]), there were only three electricity trading approaches
present when this paper was written. The first one, provided by von Luckner et al. [43],
discusses optimal market-making strategies in the context of the German intraday market.
Meanwhile, Glas et al. [14] and Glas et al. [15] addressed a more general numerical execu-
tion approach for both renewable and conventional generation output. Finally, Coulon and
Ströjby [7] presented a preliminary model on executing volumes of renewable generation in
| an optimal | manner. |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
We aim to position the topic of optimal execution more prominently in the current dis-
cussion of German intraday markets and analyze various approaches in the remainder of this
paper. Our work is structured as follows: Section 2 takes a deeper look at order books and
the underlying data. Most of the time, actual trades are analyzed in the context of intraday
trading which is why we need to address what distinguishes order book data from trades. In
the course of the data discussion, we will derive the problem of optimal execution in a more
formal way. Section 3 introduces execution approaches and discusses, which weaknesses they
exhibit in the context of electricity markets. Leaving the theoretical part aside, we compute
trading trajectories under different scenarios and evaluate the results in an empirical out-of-
sample study in Section 4 and summarize our findings and the contributions of this paper in

best bid is the order that is willing to buy at the highest price, while the best ask is that ready to sell at the
lowest price. Please note that there can be multiple orders at the same price level, as shown at the best bid
order.
2. Order Book Data and the Problem of Optimal Execution
2.1. Why Order Book Data are Different
If one takes a historic view of intraday papers, the evolution of complexity and availabil-
ity in the research data becomes evident. Early articles like Hagemann [18] solely used
volume-weighted average prices of the entire trading period. This modus operandi ignores
the characteristics of continuous trading and takes a more time series-oriented approach.
Later papers dealt with individual intraday trade data (e.g., Janke and Steinke [23]). They
focused on individual transactions and derived partial averages. However, this is only one
side of the coin since these papers focused on trades, i.e., the buying and selling of orders
that could be matched. Better availability of data has allowed researchers to analyze order
book data. These data-sets comprise not only trades but also unmatched orders. Orders
grant new insight into continuous trading and the market microstructure behind it.
In a limit order book (LOB), orders are continuously sorted based on the price per buying
and selling direction for each delivery hour. Thus, a typical LOB for one delivery hour can
be imagined like a t-account with buy and sell sides. Figure 2 represents an order book in
a graphical manner. All buy orders, or the "bid" side, are sorted in descending order, while
all sell orders, or the "ask" side, are ordered in ascending order, such that the best sell order
in the market is the one with the lowest price.
The next crucial aspect of understanding LOB data is timing. Figure 2 displays a snap-
shot of one specific second. However, we need to define a describing element that discretizes
countless snapshots and aggregates the information. The bid-ask spread (BAS) serves this

Figure 3: Median bid-ask spread from January 2018 to November 2019. The data were aggregated in
minute buckets and reflect the development of spreads under the trading volume, i.e., the typical cost of
trading averaged for one minute of order book activity for the first 0 to 10 MW, 10 to 25 MW, and the next

aspect well as it compresses buy and sell orders into one numerical figure. However, LOB
data are not one-dimensional. Figure 2 reveals the connection of volumes available at differ-
ent price levels. It makes no sense to focus on the best bid and ask for the BAS computation
if the volume sums up to 0.1 MWh. Therefore, we aggregate the BAS into different volume
buckets, i.e., BAS per first 1 MW traded, BAS for the volume between 1 and 5 MW, and so
on (see Section 2.2 for the mathematical formulation). Last but not least, we need a second
level of discretization to cover the aspect of time. We can aggregate our data into minute
buckets such that we can identify the best 1 MW BAS over an interval of one minute of
trading, for instance.
We used LOB data from 01.01.2019 to 27.11.2019 provided by EPEX Spot SE. The data
can be purchased from EPEX Spot SE. For more information on EPEX order book data and
the required data preparation, refer to Martin and Otterson [32]. Unfortunately, the data
are not completely available for the year 2019, which is why Figure 3 ends in late November
2019. We also split the data into training (year 2018) and out-of-sample testing (year 2019).
Some execution algorithms require historic data for model training. We used the entire year
of 2018 for model training. All data of 2019 were used to benchmark the models in an out-
of-sample manner.
The series of median BAS data, as shown in Figure 3, does not suggest any yearly sea-
sonality. There are some spikes, but, all in all, the spreads seem to be stable across the year.
Figure 4 zooms in and shows the median BAS per weekday and delivery hour as well as
the corresponding traded volume. A similar pattern evolves for both the weekly and hourly

bid-ask series. They appear to be stable no matter the day or delivery hour. The market
participants seem to have similar order quoting behavior. This is an important first obser-
vation as it leads to a conclusion on execution algorithms. If quoting is stable, considering
seasonality is not a major concern. The picture changes with the trading volume. Saturdays
and Sundays feature lower trading volumes. Figure 4 delivers evidence for hourly patterns:
| The delivery | hours 1—7 | show signs | of less | trading | volume. |     |     |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --- | --- |
Last but not least, we want to analyze the continuous trading character of German intra-
day markets. Figure 5 shows how the median BAS behaves with respect to time to delivery.
Its level is constant over time but changes 60 and 30 minutes before delivery. This effect is
connected to the local coupling of markets. One hour before delivery, no European orders
are coupled under XBID with the German market anymore, and 30 minutes before delivery,
local within-grid area trading starts (see Kath [24]). Consequently, volumes sharply drop
at 60 and 30 minutes to recover later. Figure 5 is also a good summary of the problem of
optimal execution itself. How should volumes be distributed over the available trading time
up to delivery? Moreover, how should volumes be sliced to ensure that a minimum spread is
paid?

The amount of data with LOB requires different handling than that with trade data. Our
dataset is around 60 GB, it does not allow for simple calculation on an order basis anymore
but demands an aggregation approach. Orders need to be aggregated by and
time trading
volume. We will start with time. To understand the concept of time aggregation, a few
notations need to be introduced. Imagine one line in our data frame as
|     | Z   | : {y ,v ,s | ,e ,d   | |t = | 1,...,T ∧d = [buy,sell]}. |     | (1) |

Let this be the set of all buy and sell orders at delivery time t comprising its price y ,
t,d
the volume of an order denoted as , its start , and expiry time stamp in seconds
|     |     |     | v   |     | s   | e   |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     |     | t,d |     | t,d | t,d |     |
from the start of the observation. We divide the difference between the reception of any
position to be traded at i and the delivery at time t in equidistant steps k = 1,...,N ,
|     | (cid:106) |     | (cid:107) |     |     |     |     |

where N = t − i . Thus, we have k buckets of one minute in length. The
|     | (24×60×60) | (24×60×60) |     |     |     |     |     |

parameter is a dynamic one depending on the arrival of the position at i. That means
k
that if the time of arrival changes, the computation of the optimal execution likewise differs,
as the length of k is different. Based on k, it is possible to define time discretization buckets

which comprise all active orders1 in the k-th minute interval bucket for each delivery time
stamp t and direction d. Note that this automatically filters out unnecessary information
present before the position arrival at i, which reduces the memory space used. The choice
of minute buckets seems suitable for the EPEX intraday market as with lower granularity,
one faces many instances with missing data as there are simply no new activities, e.g., one
will face many buckets with no trades every second. However, decreasing the resolution to
15-minute buckets lessens the trading abilities of the algorithms and might turn out to be
a poor choice, as the volume is split on fewer buckets with less trades but more volume per
trade and, as a consequence, higher spreads. Therefore, one-minute buckets appear to be a
good compromise. Other approaches like Glas et al. [15] use five minute intervals, but we

First, we define auxiliary volume buckets b with r = 1,...,23 for our aggregation logic

[500,∞]. This leads to a refined version of Eq. (2) that allocates not only based on the k-th
| time | bucket | but also | on the | r-th | volume | bucket | in  |     |     |     |

The buckets serve as separators for the cumulative volume. Obviously, trading costs
b
r
vary over time. However, they also change with the designated trading volume, as depicted
in Figure 5. The LOB is ordered by price in the case of both buying and selling. Unless
all orders are entered with identical prices, a price ladder will emerge. The best buy and
sell prices might feature only a small share of the total volume. As a consequence, trading
usually gets more expensive with large quantities. We can take this aspect into consideration
| by  | aggregating | buckets | by volume |     | as well. |     |     |     |     |     |

One could argue that the aspect of time-weighted orders is missing in this approach. It

• ThealgorithmscanonlyacceptexistingordersintheLOBandactivelypaytheBAS.To
understand this concept, we need to discuss the two execution alternatives. A market
player can initiate an order by quoting a price and volume pair. Say, for instance, the
best buy order is at 50 €/MWh, and the best sell order is at 51 €/MWh. A trader
can initiate another buy at 50.10 €/MWh and wait for execution, Or they can actively
accept an existing order by entering a buy at 51 €/MWh, which results in immediate
execution as there is a corresponding sell order available. Technically speaking, the
latter can be seen as an active click in the LOB. We assume it as the only way to trade,
since waiting for other traders to accept the order is very complex to depict. It requires

Time to delivery

trading with respect to time to delivery. The x-axis shows the time in minutes until physical delivery. The

emphasize how well our optimization model can anticipate costs measured as median spreads.
• The optimal execution is probed for a fixed trading volume. This is, for instance, the
case for plant outages that need to be covered in the intraday market. Generation up-
dates for renewable energy sources imply uncertainty in forecasts and changing position
sizes, which add another dimension of complexity and are ignored in this paper.
• Following Narajewski and Ziel [33], the intraday market is considered as efficient in this
paper. Thus, we do not have any view or opinion on price developments and only focus
|     | on execution. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

• All algorithms stop their activities 30 minutes before delivery. Kath [24] showed that
this is the time when intra-control area trading starts. Therefore, it makes sense to
see this threshold as an operational barrier, as no Germany-wide trading is possible
anymore. Apart from that, the EPEX indices ID3 and ID1 stop 30 minutes before
delivery (for an ID3 example, see Uniejewski et al. [41]), which makes our approach
time-congruent with the EPEX data. This implies that, for instance, k = 180 means
180 minutes of trading starting from 210 minutes2 before delivery up to 30 minutes
|     | before | delivery. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

| 3.1.1. | Determinants |           | of  | Optimal    | Execution |     |     |     |     |
The first model on optimal execution was provided by Bertsimas and Lo [4]. Their contri-
bution was a consideration of market impact, meaning the temporary and constant change
of prices due to own trading activity. Almgren and Chriss [2] expanded the idea by taking
into account the traders’ risk appetite. They proposed a mean-variance-based approach that
locates an optimum between minimizing the trading costs and minimizing the variance of
costs. Later on, Almgren [3] expanded the existing model with a non-linear market impact
function. All models share that they were applied on equity markets and have not been fully
tested in electricity intraday markets for optimal execution yet. Herein, we borrow basic
principles from the above mentioned papers and derive a suitable model for intraday power
markets.
First, we need to introduce some further notations that are important for our model (see
Table 1 for a detailed description of the model parameters). We have
• a price y (meaning a more general notation of prices here than the one of Section 2.2,

In the case of buying positions, n shall be positive and in the case of selling positions n

shall be negative. This assumption allows us to have a position-neutral notation, as buying

Another very important concept is the idea of market impact. A common approach (e.g.,

have re-entered their orders, which is why its determinants n and k − 1 are lagged in

Eq. (4). The underlying price model, based on Almgren and Chriss [2], is assumed to follow

The permanent market impact refers to the most recent time lag as the latest order is
assumed to influence the current prices in the form of its permanent market impact function.
Note that we have left out any drift term in Eq. (5). However, since electricity tends to be
mean-reverting, a drift term does not seem to be suitable for intraday markets. We define

The costs are given by the volatility of prices and the two market impacts. In addition
to just optimizing costs, Almgren and Chriss [2] proposed a mean-variance approach to
execute volume under the constraint of risk aversion. Based on the idea of a mean-variance
optimum such as the one in the modern portfolio theory of Markowitz [31], one can compute
the expected costs and its variance from Eq. (6) and derive a mean-variance

while the second assumes a certain level of risk aversion3 with λ = 2x10(−5). Thus, we
present two different models suitable for different levels of risk appetite. However, to finally
compute a solution for Eq. (7), we need to determine the market impact model in the next
sub-section.

| ------ | --- | ------ | --- | --------- | --- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Market impact models determine the mathematical complexity of Eq. (6) to a great extent
but are also the core of the execution approach as they determine the costs. Financial
markets often assume less repercussions from individual trading and imply a linear influence,
as done by Almgren and Chriss [2]. Exponential approaches are also utilized (see Almgren
[3]). Another frequently applied approach is the square-root impact model. It is versatile and
works in many diverse markets such as crypto or options trading as Tóth et al. [40] pointed
out. Gatheral et al. [13] proposed a transient yet linear price impact model that decays over
time. However, there is no blueprint ready for intraday electricity markets, which is why we
follow a data-driven approach herein and derive a numerical model based on the intraday
data of the year 2018. But how can we measure permanent and temporary market impact
3Our choice of lambda shall ensure an appropriate level of risk aversion. We tried more aggressive levels
and found that they do not cause large differences as more traded volume means much higher costs. The
algorithm always tries to balance the costs, even if less volatility in costs is desired. Hence, we believe the
current selection is appropriate, as the other values do not change the path too much.

based on an LOB? Permanent market impact is that which evolves after a trade and is often
caused by liquidity providers that adjust their price levels after the arrival of transactions.
As an approximation, we first compute the mean of all trades happening within a range of
10 seconds, as shown in Figure 6. After another 40 seconds of time delay, assuming that
the order book normalizes again, we compute the median BAS averaged over 20 seconds and
compare its level to the aggregated BAS before the arrival of trades. We also group the
output in volume buckets to reflect that the market impact depends on the traded volume.
The resulting data derivation is also shown in Figure 6.
Temporary market impact vanishes immediately after trading and can be described as a
liquidity premium that is demanded for higher volumes in the current order book. Traders
are less willing to quote at the best possible price if the volumes are very large. The impact is

temporary, as one pays a volume premium and, afterward, the order book volumes normalize
again. Here, we derive the temporary impact by means of the BAS per volume bucket. Based
on the year 2018, the median BAS per volume is used to derive a cost curve per minute
bucket k, delivery hour, and weekday (see Figure 7). As mentioned above, we receive two
cost structures that increase with higher volumes of n and less time to delivery based on
k
the minute buckets k and—minding the seasonality of electricity prices—vary slightly across
delivery hours and weekdays (see Wolff and Feuerriegel [44] for seasonality). We model the
evolving relationship between impact in euros/MWh and the mentioned determinants as a

Stasinopoulos [37] and the splines are computed using the function. We use the log as a

The most simplistic form of splines are cubic ones, meaning an ensemble of piecewise
polynomials of order three that join each other at different knots (see Stasinopoulos et al.
[39] for more insight into splines in the context of GAMs). The more knots used, the more
“fitted” the resulting curve is. Obviously, the choice of an appropriate spline setting is not
trivial and could lead to overfitting. A way to overcome this issue is presented by Eilers and

In a limited backtest study, p-splines modeled the impact curves of Figure 7 best. The gen-
eral goodness of fit is also reflected by the dashed lines in Figure 5.
The non-linear, complex modeling of market impact distinguishes our approach from stud-
ies like Glas et al. [15], which applied a simpler polynomial fit. The other novelty of our
approach is the explicit consideration of trading characteristics. Figure 7 shows the relation-
ship between impact in euros per MWh and its determinant volume (denoted as ) and

lead-time (minute buckets k) in a three-dimensional way. Figure 5 plots the relationship
in a more detailed way. Another important aspect to note is the striking increase around

60 minutes before delivery. This has to do with the lack of coupling afterward. Normally,
XBID is only active until one hour before delivery, meaning that during the last 60 minutes of
trading, orders are solely German ones in the German LOB. Due to system restrictions, most
market players delete their orders and re-enter them at this specific point in time, leading to
two minutes of low liquidity and high BAS levels. Both Figures 5 and 7 confirm that. Thus,
we need to introduce a dependency of time until delivery to realistically model the market
impact. Therefore, we split the trading session into three regimes (as shown in Figure 5 as
| well): | XBID, | cutover | phase, | and | non-XBID |     | trading | in  |     |     |     |

with N being the number of k minute buckets. Note that we define the cutover phase as
2 minutes, starting from 59 to 60 minutes before delivery and ending in the minute bucket
starting from 60 and ending 59 minutes prior to delivery. The data suggest that both minute
aggregates feature a special impact behavior. Combining the formal definition of Eq. (8) as
well as the timing separation from above leads to our approximation µˆ of the true parameter

Note that the variance of each model is also computed by the GAM model in the form of
estimated parameter σˆ. Due to the separation into the three regimes, we have three different
sigmas per impact function: one for XBID, one for local trading, and one for the cutover
phase.
Theterm g(x) denotesapenalizedsplinefunctionoftheinputvariable x discussedearlier
in the context of Eq. (12). The function g(x) does not depend on lead time in the case of
the cutover regime, as the model requires at least four distinct values to compute a spline.
During cutover, we only have two individual k values. The functions h(t) and we(t) of Eqs.
(15)—(17) extract peak/off-peak hours and weekend information out of delivery time stamp
t and transform it into a binary dummy variable such that the model separates between
different times.

Note that we assume independence of the three cost components in Eq. (18) such that the
covariance of the three terms is assumed to be zero. Since all components are deterministic
and do not depend on a random variable, their expectation is simply the function itself.
Minding the deterministic character leads to the variance given by

We tried a variety of different approaches such as simulated annealing or gradient-based
non-linear optimizers and found that a genetic algorithm (see Holland [21] or Goldberg and
Holland [16]) works well in our case. It is readily implemented in the R-package GA of Scrucca
[38] and—inspired by genetic processes—mutates an initial population on a random basis.
Only the parameter combinations that generate the best values for the objective function in
Eq. (20) survive, and the process is repeated again until no more decrease of cost is reached

The last section introduced our novel execution approach tailor-made for intraday markets.
Section 3.2 will present more general execution strategies that serve as a performance bench-
mark. The first approach is not a strategy per se but the most simplistic form of trade
execution. Instant order book execution (IOBE) does not require any computation or pre-
defined trade trajectory. Instead, an energy trader just accepts existing orders in the order
book and trades the full volume at once. In mathematical terms, this strategy is

trading system on either the bid or the ask side. It implies a willingness to pay the BAS for
the sake of instant execution. Figure 7 indicates the downside of such simplicity. The higher
the volume, the higher the BAS is. Prices are less favorable, as the trader has to accept not
only the first few orders on top of the order book but a number of deeper ones as well. This

usually leads to prices being far from the surrounding small volume trades and implies a high
degree of market impact of a singular and large volume order. Another associated risk is
given by price developments. Since the trade is entered at a specific point in time, prices can
develop adversely after the trade. This effect is less apparent with small slicing strategies
that trade over the entire time window. As such, why do traders use IOBE? To start, its
profitability is highly dependent on the traded volume. For small traders, IOBE might be a
cost-effective way to cover open positions. More sophisticated approaches like the ones that
follow require algorithms that allocate volumes and slice them down to multiple trades. An
application programming interface (API) connection to the exchange as well as a designated
software solution is needed, while with IOBE trades, trading can be done manually via any
exchange trading system. Thus, there is a trade-off between trading costs occurring through
IOBE versus the additional costs caused by API connections and IT systems.
3.2.2. Time-Weighted Average Price Execution
Another very common strategy is an equidistant allocation of the entire volume on each
volume bucket. Almgren and Chriss [2] referred to this as a minimum-impact strategy, but
intheworldoftrading, suchalgorithmsarecommonlydenotedastime-weightedaverageprice
(TWAP) execution. The idea is very simple. Regardless of empirical volume distributions,
volumes are equally distributed over time such that n = n = ... = n or

The term minimum impact might be correct at first sight since we slice the volume into as
many small pieces as possible (depending on the number of k = 1,...,N trading buckets)
and try to tackle the factor market influence with position size. However, the strategy does
not need to be the one with the smallest market impact, as this disregards the distribution
of the trading volume or lead time. If one trades equal amounts and the trading volume is
distributed very unequally over time, an order can cause a larger market impact in a low-
liquidity time frame, leading to an overall larger impact than desired. However, Figure 5
shows that the trading volume is constant for a long time and only changes substantially in
the late trading phase, which is why we think the strategy can still be a simple enhancement
to IOBE.

| 3.2.3. Volume-Weighted |           | Average    | Price Execution |     |     |
The thoughts of sub-section 3.2 bring us to a closely connected strategy. While TWAP
approaches do not consider deviations in trading volumes, volume-weighted average price
(VWAP) algorithms explicitly do. Papers like Konishi [28] propose a VWAP algorithm that
tries to minimize the difference between the actual VWAP of all trades and the trader’s own
VWAP. We deliberately deviate from this as our goal is not index replication but optimal
execution. For more information on index replication strategies and pricing of such con-
tracts, the interested reader might refer to Guéant and Royer [17], Humphery-Jenner [22]

in the last hour. Some VWAPs do not comprise the full trading session, which is why they
are sometimes called partial VWAPs as by Narajewski and Ziel [33] and Kath [24]. In order

such that sufficient volume is traded. Since the strategy allocates higher volumes to trading
phases with large traded volumes, it could be a profitable way to execute positions.
4. Intraday Market Execution Simulation
4.1. Resulting Trading Trajectories
Different algorithms result in different trading trajectories. Section 3 focused on a mathe-
matical formulation. In addition, we want to discuss trading behavior to sharpen the under-
standing of the numerical results. The easiest way to understand volume allocation behavior
isbyinspectinga tradepathplot. Figure8showsthetradingtrajectoriesofall algorithms. It

assumes a volume of 270 MW to be executed in 270 minute-buckets4. The two optimization
algorithms Opti and Opti yield different paths per total position to be executed. However,
σ(cid:118) C
the differences are marginal, and only very large positions lead to a slightly smoother curve.
Therefore, we have decided to plot 270 MWh as a compromise. Positions around 200—300
MWh apply to many market participants and depict an industry-wide optimal execution
problem.
Here, IOBE executes the entire volume in the first minute bucket. This is arguably the
simplest form of execution and leads to one big trade. In contrast to that, the TWAP
approach equally splits the volume in equidistant steps, which yields a straight and linear
execution reflected by a black dashed line. It serves as a good reference path to compare all
other algorithms against. The TWAPs try to minimize the impact by means of the smallest
equidistant steps possible. This sounds rather naive but could prove profitable if we recap
the sharp exponential growth of BAS with the higher volumes depicted in Figure 5. Hence, it
is interesting to see how other approaches deviate from this. The VWAP algorithm allocates
based on historic volume distributions over time. This leads to an interesting pattern. The
trading volume increases with time to delivery, as shown in Figure 4. The VWAP algorithm
shifts a bit of volume into later trading phases. In the middle of the selected trading win-
dow, its inventory position is around 10 MWh higher compared to the TWAP allocations.
However, the overall change is small and does not lead to a drastic change.
Another interesting pattern evolves with Opti . Recall that this algorithm purely opti-
C
mizes costs based on a GAM trained on 2018 data. The algorithm starts with slower trading
rates than all other approaches and leaves a higher position open in the early and mid-
trading phases. A striking behavior happens shortly before the switch from pan-European
XBID trading to local German trading. Starting at around k = 185, positions are closed
more aggressively compared to TWAP and all other models, which results in a smaller open
position when local trading starts. Taking a look at Figure 5, this makes perfect sense as this
decision avoids the high BAS levels in local trading. Figure 8 makes it almost impossible to
see, but both optimization approaches avoid the very expensive cutover phase entirely.
Opti is closely connected to the pure cost optimization but considers risk aversion in the
σ(cid:118)
form of the volatility of prices and bid-ask spreads. If one recalls, that this approach balances
between expected trading costs (which means equally sized small volumes per bucket) and
4Westoptrading30minutesbeforedeliveryasthereisonlyintra-gridareatradingallowedfromthispoint
onwards. However, this means that a lead time (i.e., the nominal time to delivery) of 300 minutes results in
270 minutes of trading.

the variance of expected costs, it becomes evident that the algorithm tries to avoid additional
variance at the cost of slightly higher market impact. This leads to an almost TWAP-like
trading path. One could ask why there is no remarkable change in the trajectories as shown
by Almgren and Chriss [2], wherein mean-variance approaches resulted in very different trade
trajectories. The answer is given by the market impact functions. The mentioned paper as-
sumed a linear impact. Thus, risk aversion does not cause the trader to pay a large premium
in the form of bid-ask spreads for the sake of less variance in costs and execution prices. An
optimization algorithm could easily shift trading volumes into early trading phases without
causing an exponential cost increase. This is different from intraday trading and our market
impact models. Every time trading is shifted away from a late trading point to an early one,
this causes an exponential growth in costs while reducing volatility in an exponential way
as well. Our parameter choice for seems to be very conservative. Thus, Opti carefully
λ
σ(cid:118)
balances between expected costs and volatility. However, we found that even more aggressive
choices for λ do not create substantially different trading trajectories. This is interesting as
intraday markets feature price spikes and a generally high level of volatility, as mentioned
by Wolff and Feuerriegel [44]. Although there is a high level of volatility, a mathematically
optimized execution seems to deviate only partially from the benchmark path of TWAP al-
location.
Despitethefactthatwehaveadiversesetofalgorithmictradingmodelsthatdifferintrad-
ing, computational complexity, and consideration of market impact, the trading trajectories
are less heterogeneous than expected. In fact, this leads to the first interesting conclusion.

We want to first focus on realized execution costs in the form of BAS, more formally
| defined | as  |     |     |     |     |       |            |           |     |     |      |

|         |     |     |     |     | BAS | = (y  |            | −y        | ).  |     | (30) |

Hence, the BAS is aggregated per delivery date t, minute bucket and accumulated vol-
k,
ume r. Using it as a benchmark also covers the most important trade execution aspects
mentioned by Perold [36]. Table 2 grants a first overview of our empirical simulation. Since
the mean is not a robust measure in the case of outliers, we have decided to focus on the
median and only report the mean in brackets for the sake of completeness. The first striking
observation is the high level of BAS if IOBE execution is concerned. It becomes obvious
that actively “clicking away” the entire volume at once leads to a dramatic cost level that
no company should aim for. Simple approaches like TWAP that do not require massive
computation already beat IOBE by far. The VWAP strategy is also much better than IOBE

4.2 Realized Execution Costs and Variance 25
but stays behind TWAP in most cases. This is somehow unexpected and shows that a huge
trading volume does not necessarily go hand in hand with low spreads.
The dedicated optimization algorithm Opti performs as expected when the volumes per
C
bucket are low and beats all other approaches. However, this is only the case if there is lots
of time to close positions, i.e., when the lead time is 300 or when there is less volume to be
traded. But why is that so? We can think of two reasons. Taking a closer look at Figure 5,
we can see that the dashed black line is below the actual spreads in the late trading phases
before XBID. That means that the costs in local trading are slightly overestimated. Our
choice of 60 minutes to trade seems to underline the model limitations. The optimization
model exhibits weaknesses if applied in late trading and forced to trade large volumes. The
other explanation is more pragmatic. We have used 2018 data to train the models, but that
does not necessarily mean that identical patterns will evolve for 2019. Parts of the differences
might also be due to the random noise that is present with all empirical approaches.
Opti expands Opti by a certain level of risk aversion that flattens the trading volumes.
σ(cid:118) C
Consequently, there is a shift in performance. In phases where Opti performs well, a pre-
C
mium in the form of slightly lower performance is paid. In the case of Opti suffering from
C
limitations, the risk-averse approach Opti loses less. All models struggle to keep their spread
σ(cid:118)
level when volumes increase. This observation makes sense, as the resulting orders hit deep
layers in the order book and more spread is paid. There is no difference between the TWAP
results in the cases of 100- and 300-MW volume for a lead time of 90 minutes. While this
is contradictory at first, a deeper look gains more insight. We have aggregated into time
and volume buckets, and 300 MW/100 MW allocated into 60 time buckets means trades of
5 MW and 1.1 MW each. It is important to note that our second volume bucket spans from
1 to 5 MW, meaning that both orders result in the same out-of-sample spread simply due to
our aggregation logic being too gross in that specific scenario. That is the reason why some
algorithms’ results equal each other.
We can see that the optimization approach makes sense in many scenarios. However, does
that postulation hold true under a stricter statistical analysis? A one-sided t-test that checks
for the significance of Opti BAS levels being lower than the TWAP and VWAP brings more
C
clarity (see results in Table 3). All scenarios with 300-MW positions are clearly significant.
The results for 100 MW and 90 minutes of lead time are a bit better but do not persist
under our stricter framework. The differences could also be random-based. Higher volumes
and 90 minutes of lead time are clearly not significant, which further underlines the inherent
Opti model’s limitations. But what does that mean in terms of monetary effects? Our
C
optimization model outperforms all other models by around 15 ct/MWh if we stick to the

4.2 Realized Execution Costs and Variance 26
more robust median BAS as our measure of choice. Say a trader usually trades 100 MW per
day and hour. As an approximation for the premium on either a buy or sell trade, we assume
the half-spread, i.e., BAS /2. We acknowledge that this assumption requires symmetric
t,k,j
savings for buy and sell trades, but for simplification matters, this should suffice. The trader
will then save 100 MW*24 hours*365 days*8 ct, the latter value being roughly the difference
between Opti and TWAP. The approach saves 70,080 euros per year due to an optimized
C
execution. Assume a volume of 300 MW 300 minutes before delivery, the alternatives being
IOBE and the optimized model. This comparison results in savings of 2,775 euros for each
individual delivery hour and underlines that optimal execution can be an important perfor-
mance driver.
Last but not least, the variance of cost requires discussion. Equations (19) and (20) re-
flect how Opti balances between minimizing cost and variance. Inevitably, mean-variance
σ(cid:118)
approaches introduce subjectivity since the risk-aversion parameter λ is chosen by the user.
One could argue that with just a few hours of trading, variance does not play a major role. If
equity trading is concerned, there are usually much longer holding periods and daily volatil-
ity reports of open position, but in intraday trading, positions are closed within minutes or
hours. However, we want to inspect if Opti achieves the goal of lower variance. Our measure
σ(cid:118)
of choice is the weighted standard deviation of BAS, defined as
(cid:118)
StdBAS =
(cid:117)
(cid:117) (cid:116)
(cid:80)T
t=1 (BAS t,k,r −µ t,r )2 , (31)
(T−1) (cid:80)T valgo
T t=1 t,k,r
where T equals the length of our backtest time series and valgo the volume allocated by
t,k,r
each algorithm per delivery date t, minute bucket k, and accumulated volume r. It is
crucial to conduct a volume-weighting as the volumes are not distributed symmetrically. For
instance, IOBE trades just once but with 100% of the position. Without taking volumes into
consideration, the results would be biased. Table 4 demonstrates a mixed performance. In
some cases, the variance of Opti is low or even the lowest across all models. However, the
σ(cid:118)
difference is small and comes at the price of a higher BAS. The overall trade trajectory is
smoother and volumes are split more equally if we compare Opti with Opti . Unfortunately,
σ(cid:118) C
bothmodelssharethesameshortcomings. Opti doesnotdeliverlessvarianceinproblematic
σ(cid:118)
scenarios (low lead time and large positions). All in all, the goal of lower variance is achieved.
However, the trade-off between higher spreads and lower variance does not seem to be too
convincing in intraday markets.

The median BAS is a suitable measure as it allows for a compressed overview of performance.
However, it features two drawbacks. First, the BAS is a symmetrical measure and does not
contain any information on buy- or sell-side performance. If a company is a net seller, looking
at spreads has limited value. Second, spreads are not as easily interpretable as prices, for
instance. Many other papers utilize plain prices or averages like the ID3 or ID1 as a reference.
We want to exploit these two aspects and, additionally, benchmark our algorithms against
buy and sell prices. One might argue that the BAS is a direct result of prices, as shown in
Eq. (29). This is basically true, but for this second benchmark, we have computed the prices
from scratch following the logic of section 2.2. The findings of the price results in section
4.3 and BAS tables of section 4.2 might slightly differ due to different roundings, i.e., a price
result will not 1:1 add up to the BAS results. While this could be perceived as confusing, we
see it as an additional layer of verification as we apply a newly computed measure.
Table 5 reports all findings separated into buy and sell as well as the known scenarios
with different trading volumes and lead times. In addition, we report two volume-weighted
reference prices published by EPEX Spot SE. For a lead time of 300 minutes, that is, the
ID3, for 90 minutes until delivery, we apply the ID1. These indices do not comprise the
relevant time frames 1:1 but serve as an appropriate and reproducible benchmark. Note that
we only report the indices as a reference point but not as a measure per se. For readers
interested in index-tracking or VWAP pricing, we refer to Frei and Westray [10] and Cartea
and Jaimungal [6]. Unsurprisingly, Table 5 confirms the overall impression of our spread
analysis. Opti yields convincing results with longer lead times, or—if forced to liquidate
C
positions with shorter lead times—only in the case of small values. Moreover, TWAP also

Taking a deeper look at buying and selling separately, some interesting patterns emerge.

In low-volume scenarios, the benefits of our optimization approach are stronger when buying
volumes. This effect cancels out with higher volumes. In the case of medium volumes, one
can observe slightly better sell than buy prices (e.g., considering the difference between Opti
C
and TWAP). However, this effect is negligible. Overall, the LOB imbalance in terms of prices
is rather low. It does not seem to make a difference if one is buying or selling, which delivers
evidence to the fact that quoted volumes and resulting execution prices are symmetrical.
There might be times where this conclusion does not hold anymore, such as large plant
outages or renewables forecast updates that cause the entire market to sell generated power.
However, these go beyond our considerations and obviously seem to cancel out with a sample
| size of | almost one year | of out-of-sample |     | data. |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Another interesting insight is connected to reference prices. Many intraday papers like
Kath and Ziel [25] just apply index prices published by EPEX Spot. However, if we compare
the realized price levels to the reference price, the difference is striking. No algorithm can
trade at the reference price. Instead, an additional mark-up (selling at lower prices or buying
at higher ones) of around 0.70—1.20 €/MWh is required. But why is that so? We must keep
in mind that the reference price is a mid-price between buys and sells. So, in order to trade at
or near an ID3, a trader has to—at least partially—earn the BAS. This contradicts one of our
core assumptions, namely the active trading of positions meaning accepting orders directly in
LOBs. Our algorithms explicitly pay the BAS as they do not want to wait for execution and
face the risk of non-trading over a longer period of time. Additionally, earning the BAS, i.e.,
waiting for others to accept their own orders, requires one to be always on top of the order
book. This aspect is a trading strategy on its own, as one needs to define price aggression,

29
position sizes, and inventory risks in a different way than is done in this paper. However, the
simple comparison with reference prices reveals a major finding with large academic impact.
Even complex execution algorithms trade far from ID1 and ID3. Thus, the assumption of
trading at index prices is an unrealistic one or needs at least a proper discussion of index
replications algorithms and optimal execution. The topic itself is beyond the scope of this
paper, but the naive comparison of our results and the reference prices emphasizes a core
limitation of the majority of papers on intraday trading.
Last but not least, we want to examine if the results persist under changing conditions.
Assuming fixed positions amid all days and hours of the year is a strong assumption that will
only account for a number of very large market players. However, what if smaller traders
utilize the execution algorithms only occasionally? In addition to gaining more realistic
results, we introduce an additional robustness check by manipulating the sample. Do the
algorithms deliver a constant performance, or are the results of Table 5 only due to some
very specific events? Based on the described out-of-sample tests, we can erratically remove
days from the sample to find answers to these questions. Figure 9 plots the modus operandi.
Based on 100% of the out-of-sample data, we randomly delete 60% and then another 40%
or, first, 25% followed by 50%, which results in four different randomization paths for two
different lead-time and volume scenarios. Inspecting the results, we find that the robustness
check by sampling confirms the previous results: TWAP and VWAP are generally more
profitable in high-volume, low-lead-time scenarios, while the optimization approaches show
superior performance if given more time to trade. Thus, we have delivered evidence of the
fact that the results of Tables 2 and 5 hold true under more general conditions. They are
valid for the entire data set as well as randomly sampled parts of it, which renders them as
a good line of orientation for market players.
5. Contributions and Outlook
5.1. Conclusion
Optimal execution of positions in intraday markets, despite its importance with regard to a
trader’s performance, has only come to academic attention recently. Recent papers like Glas
et al. [15] use LOB data, aggregate information into discrete time steps, and solve numerical
optimization problems, aiming for an appropriate trade trajectory that minimizes bid-ask
spreads. Equity markets supply a rich body of literature but lack certain characteristics like
different trading regimes, short lead-times, and exponential growth of costs due to liquidity

restrictions. We provide a more refined optimization approach. Our model minimizes ex-
pected costs as well as—if desired—expected variance and outputs an optimal trading path
per minute.
Based on aggregated minute buckets, we have fitted two GAM models to consider per-
manent and temporary market impact. Our calculations have shown that penalized splines
work well for modeling the relationship between spreads and lead time, trading volumes, and
times of trading in German continuous intraday markets. Thus, the GAMs comprise mul-
tiple p-splines and model the exponential growth of median bid-ask spreads depending on
the aforementioned variables. Another important thing unprecedentedly considered by our
approach is European market coupling. A simple lead time analysis showed that BAS levels
dramatically increase when the European coupling of intraday orders under XBID stops one
hour before delivery. Although trading costs normalize shortly after this cut-over phase, their
overall level tends to be higher without coupling. Our approach takes this chronological char-
acteristic into account and models XBID trading, local German trading, and the cut-over
phase separately. To our knowledge, it is the first optimization method to incorporate so
| many market-specific |     | determinants | based |     | on 60-second | data. |     |     |

But is it worth the effort? We compared the model performance in an out-of-sample study

based on the year 2019 data against other simple benchmarks like immediate order-book ex-
ecution or time- and volume-weighted average approaches. Both measures of choice, bid-ask
spreads and plain buy and sell prices, suggest that a more complex computation yields better
execution performance in the form of lower spreads and more favorable prices. Only in late
trading phases around 90 minutes before delivery and in the case of large volumes to be
traded in that phase does a limitation of the GAM calculation become obvious. Costs are
partiallyunderestimated, whichcausesthealgorithmtotrademorethanisoptimalinspecific
time buckets. However, this only occurs when being forced to liquidate large positions. In
most scenarios, an additional saving of 10—15 cents median BAS and 15—20 cents/MWh in
the form of favorable prices can be realized. Apart from that, the study revealed how prob-
lematic simple clicks in the order book can be. If volumes increase, this form of execution
can cause additional costs of over 100 euros/MWh and should be avoided. That being said,
even simple algorithms like an equally sized split of volumes on all available time buckets
performs surprisingly well and highlight the importance of discussing the optimal execution
of trades.
Another crucial insight is connected to optimal execution and average prices. The major-
ity of current intraday trading papers (e.g., Janke and Steinke [23] and Uniejewski et al. [41]
to name a few) utilize volume-weighted price averages as their measure of choice. Our results
suggest that this is problematic. All algorithms trade around 1 euro/MWh away from those
prices. Using them without discussing the costs of trading in the form of market impact and
paid bid-ask spreads makes results appear less appealing. Additionally, we believe that the
discussion of optimal execution will play an important role in the future of electricity intra-
day trading as markets mature and margins shrink. It has a direct impact on each trader’s
performance and is applicable in almost every situation, whether it be a plant outage, a large
position update from customer load, or a proprietary view on the market.
5.2. Outlook
The previous analysis has shown that optimal execution, whilst not being extensively dis-
cussed in the literature yet, can be an interesting value driver. However, what role will
optimal execution play in the future, and how could further research promote its impor-
tance? We encourage trading-oriented forecasting approaches like that of Maciejowska et al.
[30]or Maciejowska etal.[29] todiscuss executionas well. Benchmarkslike ID3area suitable
first approximation but neglect the trading character and the fact that a trader often has to
pay bid-ask spreads. Future research should steer backtests in that direction and use order

book data whenever possible instead of trades to have more realistic results.
Concerning the methodology of this paper, there are several extensions possible. We lim-
ited our model mostly to a fixed volume that does not change over time. While this is
convenient for many cases, typical RES generation implies erratic position changes. Thus,
the algorithm and its underlying optimization problem might be extended to consider the
random character of volumes. Another interesting direction for further research is given by
the market impact functions. They are crucial for volume allocation and determine trading
behavior to a great extent. We have derived a suitable implementation based on data, but
other approaches could prove to be even better. The empirical study of Section 4 revealed
model limitations with larger volumes and less time to trade. The authors assumed that
the market impact functions generally work better with low volumes. The model underes-
timates the exponential effects of high trading amounts per volume bucket in late coupled
trading. Therefore, it could turn out to be beneficial to benchmark other impact models such
as the transient one of Gatheral et al. [13] or the well-known and often utilized square-root
model (see Tóth et al. [40]). A general comparison of different approaches would sharpen
the understanding of intraday market microstructure. Last but not least, the present paper
limited its focus to hourly trading. Quarter-hourly continuous trading works similarly but
is—due to missing European sister markets—not as widely coupled as its hourly opponent.
An analysis and modeling of quarter hours would be novel and could add further insight into
how intraday markets work.
